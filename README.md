# Whisper CLI (Backendless, AI-Powered)

Whisper CLI is an open-source, AI-powered code security and code analysis tool for developers, teams, and security analysts. It works entirely standalone‚Äîno backend, no authentication, no analytics, and no rate limits. All you need are your own AI API keys!

## ‚ú® Features
- **AI-powered code scanning** for vulnerabilities and improvements
- **Explain code** with advanced AI models
- **Suggest and auto-fix issues** using AI
- **Pre-commit security guard** for Git
- **Works with OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic APIs**
- **No backend, no login, no tracking**

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Install via npm (recommended)

```sh
npm install -g whisper-cli-ai
```

### 2. Or clone from GitHub (for open source contributors)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whisper.git
cd whisper
npm install
npm run build
npm link # (optional, to use as a global CLI)
```

## üîë Setup: Provide Your AI API Keys

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open `.env` and add your API keys for any of the following:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Google Gemini)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (OpenAI)
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Anthropic Claude)

You only need to provide the keys for the AI providers you want to use.

## üìÇ Using .whisperignore

You can create a `.whisperignore` file in your project root to exclude files and folders from being scanned by Whisper CLI. This works just like a `.gitignore` file.

- **Why?** To speed up scans and avoid analyzing files you don't care about (e.g., `node_modules`, build output, logs, etc).
- **How?** Add one pattern per line. Example:

```
node_modules/
dist/
build/
*.log
.env
.git/
coverage/
```

- **Default ignores:** Whisper CLI already ignores common folders like `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, etc. Your `.whisperignore` will be merged with these defaults.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Scan your code for vulnerabilities
```sh
whisper scan [path] [options]
```
- Example:
  ```sh
  whisper scan . --ai --model gpt-4o
  ```

### Explain a file or function
```sh
whisper explain <file> [options]
```
- Example:
  ```sh
  whisper explain src/index.js --model gemini-1.5-pro
  ```

### Suggest and auto-fix issues
```sh
whisper fix [path] [options]
```

### Use the AI chat mode
```sh
whisper chat [options]
```

### Add a Git pre-commit security guard
```sh
whisper guard --install
```
