# Whisper CLI

## Authentication Setup

The Whisper CLI uses backend-managed AI providers for enhanced security analysis. You only need to authenticate with your Whisper account:

```bash
# Login to your Whisper account
whisper auth login

# Check authentication status
whisper auth status
```

All AI provider keys are managed securely on the backend - no local API keys required.
